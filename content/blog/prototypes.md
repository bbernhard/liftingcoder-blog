If you are developing hardware, you probably know that problem: What to do with all the prototypes? Let's be honest nothing ever works the first time. So, one usually ends up with multiple prototypes showing the various stages of the final piece. In the past my "solution" was to throw all the prototypes in a bin and put them in deep storage.

Over the years however I realized that not only the final product counts, but also the knowledge and experiences one has gained working on it. So, instead of hiding the failures in a box, I want to display them.That's why I've mounted a piece of wood in my workshop, where I put all my ~~failures~~ experiences.

The cool thing about this little artwork is, that it is constantly evolving and never finished - which is a perfect analogy for life. You never stop learning.
