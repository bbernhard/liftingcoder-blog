            If you are developing hardware, you probably know that problem: What to do with all the prototypes? Let&rsquo;s be honest nothing ever works the first time. So, one usually ends up with multiple prototypes showing the various stages of the final piece. In the past my &ldquo;solution&rdquo; was to throw all the prototypes in a bin and put them in deep storage.
Over the years however I realized that not only the final product counts, but also the knowledge and experiences one has gained working on it.

            Recently I stumbled across a big arcade button on Amazon. You know, that big red buzzer buttons that people slam down in Quiz Shows if they know the answer. I always wanted to have one - even though I didn&rsquo;t know what to actually build with it at that point.

After the button was sitting in a drawer for several weeks, one day while listening to music, I got an inspiration: Wouldn&rsquo;t it be cool to slam down a button to turn the music on and off?

            Since I first saw online images of laser-cut city maps, I knew I wanted to build something like that myself. Now, as a proud owner of an Xtool D1 with an Extension Kit for several months, and with my girlfriend&rsquo;s birthday just around the corner and no gift yet in hand, I realized this would be the perfect opportunity. Choosing the 8th district of Vienna as the motif holds particular significance for my girlfriend, adding a personal touch to the gift.

            I&rsquo;ve always wanted to build my own useless machine. What is a useless machine you ask? It&rsquo;s a simple gadget with a switch that, when flipped on, immediately switches itself off. Sounds like a quirky project, right?
A Useless Machine in Minecraft
Even though there are plenty of useless machine designs out there, I wanted mine to differ in these points:
The device shouldn&rsquo;t drain its battery when not in use.

            Who knows this problem? Over the years, one has accumulated gigabytes of photos, capturing a snapshot of every moment worth remembering, only to hardly ever look at the photos again. That&rsquo;s how it was for me too - on my Nextcloud Share, there are tens of thousands of photos, neatly organized and sorted, condemned to gather digital dust.
But I wanted to change that. And thus, the Mindful Picture Frame was born.
