      <description>Since I first saw online images of laser-cut city maps, I knew I wanted to build something like that myself. Now, as a proud owner of an Xtool D1 with an Extension Kit for several months, and with my girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s birthday just around the corner and no gift yet in hand, I realized this would be the perfect opportunity.

      <description>Who knows this problem? Over the years, one has accumulated gigabytes of photos, capturing a snapshot of every moment worth remembering, only to hardly ever look at the photos again. That&amp;rsquo;s how it was for me too - on my Nextcloud Share, there are tens of thousands of photos, neatly organized and sorted, condemned to gather digital dust.&#xA;But I wanted to change that. And thus, the Mindful Picture Frame was born.</description>
