    <p>If you are developing hardware, you probably know that problem: What to do with all the prototypes? Let&rsquo;s be honest nothing ever works the first time. So, one usually ends up with multiple prototypes showing the various stages of the final piece. In the past my &ldquo;solution&rdquo; was to throw all the prototypes in a bin and put them in deep storage.</p>
<p>Over the years however I realized that not only the final product counts, but also the knowledge and experiences one has gained working on it. So, instead of hiding the failures in a box, I want to display them.That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve mounted a piece of wood in my workshop, where I put all my <del>failures</del> experiences.</p>
<p>The cool thing about this little artwork is, that it is constantly evolving and never finished - which is a perfect analogy for life. You never stop learning.</p>
