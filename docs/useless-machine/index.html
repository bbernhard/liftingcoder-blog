    <p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to build my own useless machine. What is a useless machine you ask? It&rsquo;s a simple gadget with a switch that, when flipped on, immediately switches itself off. Sounds like a quirky project, right?</p>

<p>Even though there are plenty of useless machine designs out there, I wanted mine to differ in these points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The device shouldn&rsquo;t drain its battery when not in use.</li>
<li>I wanted my useless machine to have a more human touch and play with the user a bit.</li>
<li>the case should be fully 3d printed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first point was especially crucial for me. Nothing is more frustrating than a device languishing in a corner for months or even years, only to realize that its batteries need charging just when you&rsquo;re eager to engage with it.</p>
<p>For the hardware aspect of this project, I repurposed the schematics and PCB from another project of mine.</p>
<figure class="center-image"><img src="/images/useless-machine-schematic.png"
         alt="Schematic"/><figcaption>

<p>The cornerstone of this design lies in its self-holding circuit, enabling complete shutdown when the switch is turned off. Once triggered by an external push button (in this case, the machine&rsquo;s switch), the circuit activates, with the microcontroller taking charge of its subsequent shutdown.</p>
<p>A 3.3V LiFePO4 battery powers the board, chosen for its almost linear discharge curve, eliminating the need for additional voltage regulation and minimizing power loss. The brains of this project is a ESP-12E microcontroller, admittedly oversized for this task but utilized due to availability. A smaller microcontroller, like an ATtiny, would be more efficient, but given the short operational duration, the difference is negligible.</p>
<p>A Micro SG90 servo operates the finger of the Useless Machine. Despite its compact size, this servo surprises with its torque, effortlessly toggling the switch.</p>

<p>As I embarked on this project, my sole tool for constructing the case was a 3D printer. Thus, ensuring that both the case and the servo finger could be entirely printed was a priority. Intrigued by the industrial style and the weathered look of rust, I decided to experiment with metal filaments and rusting techniques.</p>
<p>After the rusting process the 3d printed case looks like this:</p>
